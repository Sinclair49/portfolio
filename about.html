         <p>Hello there!  My name's Cameron Sinclair, but I usually go by Sinclair. <br>  I come from a small town called Reidsville, North Carolina.  I'm a senior this year at UNCC, and I'm graduating at the end of the summer, 
         <br> and finally getting that long awaited computer science degree.  In my free time, I like to play electric guitar, do woodworking, bake sourdough bread, play video games, or build lightsabers.<br>I'm obviously a bit of a Star Wars fan.  I'm told by a lot of my friends, family, and coworkers that I'm a "people person", which is a sentiment I very much agree with.  <br> 
          I think that during the COVID lockdown, when I was at home doing online classes, I learned the limits of my introversion.  <br>I learned that if I am to be fulfilled, I need to work in an environment around other people, and that I didn't want to work behind a screen alone all day every day.</b> </p>
